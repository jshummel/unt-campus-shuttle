# CSCE 3444.50 - UNT Campus Shuttle

This project involves parsing UNT shuttle timetables to create a GUI application that allows for a user to search for bus route information as well as building a "smart route" based on user-supplied starting location, destination, and current or future time.

## Program Functionality
The program parses the `.csv` files and creates a graph data structure for the database. It uses this database for route processing. Routes can be added/removed based on route availability for the current UNT semester.

## Running the Program
To run the compiled program, run:
```sh
BusRouteApplication.exe
```
located in the _RELEASE folder. _IMAGES and _CSV folders need to be available in the root folder for the application to execute successfully.
